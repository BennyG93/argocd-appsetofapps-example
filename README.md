# Argocd AppSet of Apps example

This is an example showing how to use Argocd [ApplicationSets](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/application-set/) to automatically create Git Pull Request preview environments for micro-services. 

The example builds on the [App of Apps pattern](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/#app-of-apps-pattern) with the introduction of ApplicationSets. I call this "Appset of Apps".
